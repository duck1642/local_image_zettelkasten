# LMZ Current Status

Last updated: 2026-05-08

## Current Status

LMZ is a local media vault desktop app.

- Frontend: Tauri + Svelte.
- Backend: local FastAPI/Python API under `backend/`.
- Runtime model: SQLite for operational indexes; Markdown/YAML remains source of truth.
- Old Flet and PySide/PyQt UI paths are inactive.

Launch commands:

```powershell
python dev.py
python main.py
lmz
```

## Architecture Snapshot

- Frontend app: `frontend/src/`.
- Tauri shell: `frontend/src-tauri/`.
- Backend API: `backend/web_api.py`.
- Ingestion CLI: `backend/core.py`, launched by `main.py` or `lmz`.
- Runtime DB: `data/db/lmz_main.db`.
- Vault assets: `data/vault/assets/{hash[:2]}/{hash}.{ext}`.
- Vault notes: `data/vault/notes/{hash[:2]}/{hash}.md`.
- WD tag cache: `data/wd-tags/{hash[:2]}/{hash}.json`.
- Review quarantine: `data/review/`.
- Local ingest staging: `paths.local_ingest`, fallback `paths.input/local`.
- Online ingest staging: `paths.online_ingest`, fallback `paths.input/online`.
- Logs: `logs/raw/`, `logs/structured/`.
- Secrets: `secrets/`.

## Working Areas

- Local image, GIF, and video ingestion.
- External URL ingestion via gallery-dl and yt-dlp.
- Batch-safe Pixiv, X/Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, YouTube community ingestion.
- SHA256 sharded vault storage.
- Markdown note generation with frontmatter topics and distilled WD fields.
- Local WD tagging for images and sampled video frames.
- Virtualized masonry/grid vault UI.
- Grouped media navigation, fullscreen focus, zoom/pan, filmstrip.
- Structured search with prefixes, commands, suggestions, and facet counts.
- Toggleable/resizable inspector.
- Markdown queue ingestion workbench.
- Review, Stats, Settings, and App Logs views.
- Structured/raw logs plus auth-status stream.
- RAM tracker.
- Local API hardening for destructive actions.

## Useful Checks

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH='backend'
python -B -c "import ast, pathlib; [ast.parse(path.read_text(encoding='utf-8-sig'), filename=str(path)) for path in pathlib.Path('backend').rglob('*.py')]; print('AST OK')"
python -B -c "import core, web_api, db.sqlite_operator, db.search_manager, queue_service, tagging.service; print('IMPORT OK')"
cd frontend
npm run check
npm run test:large-vault
npm run build
npm run build:sidecar
git diff --check
```

Known build note: Vite may need to run outside the sandbox because it spawns helper processes.

## Done Tasks

- Project renamed to Local Media Zettelkasten / LMZ.
- Python source root renamed from `src/` to `backend/`.
- Old full-DOM masonry/grid renderers archived; virtualized renderers are active.
- Layout/zoom config writes use the shared frontend config store.
- Vault header simplified; sort/media/layout/zoom actions moved to commands.
- Auth status scan implemented:
  - startup scan.
  - `/api/auth/scan`.
  - `>scan-auth`.
  - auth log dropdown.
  - secret values are not logged.
- Auth config cleanup:
  - `cookies_path` uses relative `secrets/cookies.txt`.
  - Pixiv token loads from `secrets/.secrets.yaml`.
  - `/api/config` strips secret keys.
  - relative cookie paths resolve from project root.
- RAM tracker implemented:
  - `/api/system/memory`.
  - footer display.
  - persisted `>ram-track`.
- Fullscreen media zoom/pan implemented.
- Wide/fullscreen grouped-media filmstrip implemented.
- Inspector toggle and resize implemented.
- Vault search header split from inspector column.
- Top vault `Add Files` button removed.
- Frontend mojibake and unused default assets cleaned up.
- Svelte accessibility warnings cleared in latest reviewed pass.
- Renderer performance fixes:
  - no `will-change` layer spam.
  - `translate3d(...)` positioning.
  - grid row-math visibility.
  - batched/log-gated summaries.
  - safer media MIME helpers.
  - cleanup for timers/SSE/fetches.
- Backend hardening:
  - session key for mutating API calls.
  - local-only CORS restrictions.
  - path validation for queue/log/review endpoints.
  - bulk delete API.
  - safe delete ordering.
  - review count endpoint.
  - sidecar build path.
  - practical Tauri CSP.
- Review workflow hardening:
  - `keep` defers without DB ingest.
  - `variant` ingests with duplicate bypass.
  - `replace` ingests first, deletes old target after.
  - cleanup failures route to `pending_cleanup`.
  - Cleanup section added.
  - `/api/review/cleanup` retries cleanup and removes orphan sidecars.
  - image/video compare panes render.
  - review asset/action URLs encode filenames.
  - unique review storage names avoid collisions.
  - clean startup always mounts `/review-assets`.
  - App Logs includes `review.jsonl`.
- Review smoke follow-ups fixed:
  - `/api/review` tuple-unpack crash.
  - review logging argument collision.
  - false failure after successful variant commit.
  - best-effort retry cleanup after variant ingest.
- Local ingestion safety:
  - originals are staged before processing.
  - originals are not moved into review.
  - double-start guard set before worker scheduling.
  - retry preserves defaults and `skip_similarity`.
  - status exposes `phase`, `run_id`, `scanned`, `staged`.
  - backend results capped to last 500.
  - folder expansion streams in the worker instead of pre-sorting/materializing the tree.
- Online queue safety:
  - `as_completed` import fixed.
  - deferred and crash-preserved URLs remain in queues.
  - stop-after-current keeps not-yet-started URLs.
  - worker/platform crashes are logged and preserved.
  - queue rewrite logs original/removed/remaining counts.
- Search prefix remap completed:
  - `>` command.
  - `a:` artist.
  - `p:` platform.
  - `t:` topic.
  - `#` WD tag.
- Metadata/index performance:
  - disposable SQLite metadata index for topics and WD tags.
  - startup repair, watchdog reindex, status endpoint, rebuild endpoint.
  - topic/WD filters, facets, suggestions, and detail metadata read through index after initial backfill.
  - legacy YAML/cache fallback remains before index readiness.
- Query/render hot path fixes:
  - SQLite indexes for date/hash, artist/date/hash, platform, source artist, MIME/date, source URL.
  - artist-sort cursor pagination fixed.
  - renderer no longer builds full visual hash arrays.
  - masonry visible lookup uses bounded binary-search scanning.
- VP-tree indexing:
  - video/audio signatures append to pending items.
  - queries search built tree plus pending signatures.
  - batch updates rebuild once after batch.
- Recent validation-finding fixes:
  - vault grouping rebuilds from updated item lists.
  - masonry cache keeps geometry but refreshes current group data.
  - fullscreen pan state resets after drag and when zoom returns to 1.
  - production API startup retry handles delayed sidecar readiness.
  - ingest paths honor `paths.local_ingest` and `paths.online_ingest`.

## Deferred / Will Do Later

- Set 6 security hardening:
  - local API auth/origin/path review.
  - mutating endpoint protection pass.
  - secrets/runtime exposure review.
  - packaging-time security checks.
- Set 7 Tauri/runtime stabilization:
  - sidecar startup/shutdown lifecycle.
  - dynamic port/runtime coordination.
  - production path/config validation.
  - clean-machine package validation.
  - full Tauri stack alignment pass.
- Dynamic sidecar port binding; current port remains `8000`.
- Custom context menu for vault tiles.
- Interactive tag management in inspector.
- Native drag-and-drop import.
- Animation-aware GIF handling beyond first-frame thumbnail/tag behavior.
- Artist grouping.
- Context-aware search suggestions.
- In-memory facet cache for faster topic/WD counts.
- Persistent search index/facet tables beyond current derived metadata index.
- Search chips.
- Search/index scaling:
  - RAM hydration still bulk-loads pHash, tile, URL, and video signatures.
- Config caching:
  - `get_config()` still reparses YAML often.
  - safe invalidation is needed before broad caching.
- Video embedding performance:
  - V1 still extracts five frames with separate ffmpeg calls.
- Video hover preview strategy:
  - current hover preview can download original video.
  - options: file-size cap, backend preview clip endpoint, animated WebP thumbnail.
- YouTube community partial policy:
  - one failed expected image can still keep the post retryable.
- Source URL normalization migration:
  - existing rows are backfilled lazily by `init_database()`.
  - no standalone migration tool yet.
- Timestamp consistency:
  - local Python timestamps and SQLite UTC defaults still coexist.
- Thumbnail helper cleanup:
  - small asset-path helper duplication remains.
- Tauri package alignment:
  - frontend `@tauri-apps/api` is pinned to `2.10.1` to match Rust `tauri 2.10.x`.
  - full Tauri stack upgrade to `2.11.x` is deferred.

## Done But Needs Check

- Virtual renderer:
  - automated large-vault Playwright checks pass for 10k/100k masonry/grid and grouped mixed media.
  - needs real-vault smoke for offscreen video unmount behavior.
  - needs grouped media active-index smoke after scroll out/in.
  - needs narrow/wide zoom stability smoke.
- Resizable inspector:
  - verify separator renders as one clean line.
  - verify hover handle alignment.
  - verify content across 320-760 px.
- Fullscreen zoom/pan:
  - verify pan then backdrop click behavior.
  - verify zoom back to 1 then backdrop click closes.
  - verify video controls remain reliable.
- Filmstrip:
  - verify sizing, animation, thumbnail ergonomics, active-state visibility.
- RAM tracker:
  - verify footer text, polling behavior, unavailable frontend-memory display.
- GIF behavior:
  - original GIF animation should work in focus and markdown.
  - vault/inspector thumbnails are static first-frame previews.
  - WD tagging and duplicate detection inspect first frame.
- Production sidecar packaging:
  - build path exists.
  - needs clean-machine release validation.
- Review workflow:
  - `keep` leaves item/sidecar in review with no DB insert.
  - `delete` removes item/sidecar and decrements count.
  - `variant` ingests once and removes review source.
  - variant failure returns non-2xx and keeps item pending.
  - image/video pairs render in both panes.
- Review Windows file-lock edge case:
  - cleanup failures should remain visible as `pending_cleanup`.
  - Cleanup section should retry them.
- Ingestion close-flow:
  - close during local ingest prompts stop-after-current and exits after current item.
  - close during online ingest prompts stop-after-current and exits after in-flight workers settle.
  - deferred online URLs remain retryable after stop-after-current.
- Local ingestion:
  - successful local ingest leaves originals untouched.
  - similar duplicate moves only staged copy to review.
  - two rapid starts return one success and one `409`.
  - retry reuses defaults and `skip_similarity`.
  - large folder starts without materializing/sorting whole tree.
  - configured local/online ingest paths are honored.
- Review storage:
  - same-name files quarantine to unique storage filenames.
  - sidecars retain human `original_name`.
  - staged local names display as originals.
  - encoded review action/asset URLs work.
  - `/review-assets/{filename}` works on clean startup.
  - orphan sidecar cleanup still works with `media.ext.json`.
- Online queue safety:
  - normal and force queues preserve only their own deferred URLs.
  - failed queue receives only real failed URLs.
  - stop-after-current leaves not-yet-started URLs in source queue.
  - platform manager crash preserves that platform bucket.
  - startup import works with `as_completed`.
- Metadata edit flow:
  - selected item artist/platform/source URL updates tile, inspector, selected group, and grouping.
  - source URL empty -> shared URL moves item into URL group.
  - masonry remains stable after metadata update without stale artist/source data.
- Sidecar/API startup:
  - simulated delayed backend does not permanently fail first production API calls.

## Current Issues

None confirmed after latest inspection.
